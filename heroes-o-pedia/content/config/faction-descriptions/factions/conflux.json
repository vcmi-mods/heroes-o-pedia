		"description" : "{Conflux}\r\n\r\nA Conflux is home to the Elementalist and Planeswalker. Composed primarily of elemental creatures, the Conflux also offers home to the Sprites and the elusive Phoenix. What makes Conflux towns unique is their emphasis on creatures of mid-range power. Generals continue to debate if this is the strategic strength or weakness of the town. Regardless, all agree it takes an astute commander to effectively lead a Conflux army.\r\nConflux represents the Elemental Planes."

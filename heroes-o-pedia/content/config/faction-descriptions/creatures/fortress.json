When the stack attacks, the successful death stare occurs before the enemy has a chance to retaliate. Every gorgon in the stack has 10% chance to cause death stare. Successful stare instantly kills the 'top' unit of a stack, leaving the new 'top' unit with full health. The stare cannot kill more enemies than 1/10th of the number of Mighty Gorgons in a stack rounded up. In other words, the stare of 1â€“10 Mighty Gorgons may only kill one enemy, while a stack of 11 might kill two. Unlike most 'magic' abilities, this works on Black Dragons, but not on the undead and the unliving (such as golems and elementals)."

It may occur after they have attacked or retaliated target creature stack. The chance of poisoning the target is 30%. Poison and its effects can only be removed with the Cure spell. When poisoned, the target stack's maximum health is decreased by 10% for every combat round for three rounds. The reduction is always calculated from the creature stack's statistical maximum health. The effect is cumulative, which means that after three rounds the poisoned creature has lost 30% of its maximum health. After three rounds, the creature is no longer poisoned, but the maximum health remains decreased. The same troop can be poisoned again, but the maximum health will decrease only up to 50%. The reduction of maximum health does not kill the creatures, but it makes them more vulnerable. Immediately after a poisonous effect, 10% of previous maximum health is reduced, and the amount of health left is reduced by the same amount. There is no change even if it takes a poisonous effect again. Do not be fooled by graphic effects. Each stack can only be applied once per round. We want at least 5 rounds for maximum poisonous effect. The possible poisoning effect takes place after the attack and before the stack has chance to retaliate. The effect of poison has multiplicative effect with Ghost Dragon's aging ability. This means, that the creature stack's health could potentially be quartered. If the stack is poisoned, it is resurrected faster as Resurrection spell takes its HP after poisoning into account."
